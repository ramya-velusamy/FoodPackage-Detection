# 🥫 Food Package Quality Prediction (React + ML)

This is a machine learning-based web application built using **React.js**. The goal is to predict the quality of **unopened food packages** (like fruit boxes) using image input — either from a **file upload** or **camera** — without needing to unbox the package.
